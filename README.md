## What is Next Theme Toggle?

**Next Theme Toggle** is a one-command solution to scaffold dark/light mode support into your existing Next.js + Tailwind project. It handles everything:

- Works with Tailwind CSS (auto-installs if needed)
- Clean, minimal code with no extra fluff

---

npx next-theme-toggle

Thatâ€™s it.

Youâ€™ll get a beautiful, animated theme toggle that just works â€” no setup, no headaches.
